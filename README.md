# solar-irradiance
This is the pyGRASS code for automating solar irradiance analysis using the r.sun module in GRASS GIS for each day in a month, a process that is time-consuming when performed manually. Useful DEM-derived parameters, such as slope and aspect, were computed using the r.slope.aspect module. The Linke turbidity coefficient is based on average Linke turbidity values for tropical climates, while the albedo coefficient is derived from the land use type of the area of interest which, in this case is dense mixed forest and plantation (characterized by high canopy cover and moisture). The script for calculating the average of radiation for a month is also provided.
